  * Windows 11

  * [Vivo dual monitor arm](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K6X7YY1/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_5ZN483FWH74WFTGF8NQN?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1)
* Both locations
  * [Logitech G915 TKL keyboard](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08L8BP9KK/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_WDVRS47WTZXA40TMFV13)&#8212;I love, love, love the low profile switches on this mechanical keyboard. Turns out I should have bought the full keyboard because I do just enough numerical entry that it would be helpful.
  * [Logitech M705 Mouse](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B087Z733CM/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_HCRMNWZ03T2QA8F45Z1T)&#8212;I've owned at least five of these mice over the years. They are lightweight and have an excellent battery life.
  * [Logitech C920 Webcam](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085TFF7M1/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_9JDPZB4F2CGW9JTQKYTH?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1)

Pricy and luxurious. I like the leather cover in black.
* [Pilot G2 Pens](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006JNJ8?ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_SV5JA4CSS8YGDPNVNMCM). I especially like the Metropolitan body that uses the G2 cartridges.
