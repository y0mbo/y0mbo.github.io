Software engineers must be able to budget and plan:

> "The inability to make educated decisions about time and cost is a constant source of frustration for business stakeholders when working with software teams. The business people in charge simply want to know the cost involved and when they can realize the value of the effort. Avoiding these questions eventually creates tension, suspicion, and animosity between the team and management. Business-side people are used to planning and budgeting. Their fair expectation of software professionals is that they should have the expertise to do the same."
