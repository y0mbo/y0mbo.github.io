A pair of tweets came across my timeline, each containing obsolete things.

The first is [Obsolete Sounds](https://citiesandmemory.com/obsolete-sounds/), a site containing sounds we no longer hear in the world around us. Artists remix these sounds in new ways, an interesting justoposition.

The second is a site that archived [88x31 web buttons](https://anlucas.neocities.org/88x31Buttons.html), a common site on the web in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

Both of these remind me how things change dramatically over time, even when we don't see the pace of change on a daily basis. It's a good reminder to persist when projects don't appear to move ahead and daily habits feel futile.
