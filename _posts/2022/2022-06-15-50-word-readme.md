Manager READMEs have been an on-again, off-again thing over the last few years. The negatives are mainly because the author can't see their own weaknesses and over-values their strengths. Many readmes are long and rambling. Mike Crittenden suggests, instead, writing a [50-word personal readme](https://critter.blog/2021/12/20/50-word-personal-readmes): 

> You get 50 words, that’s it. It’s a forcing function to kill the fluff and decide what people must know about you. 

What might I write? How about: 

* Written over verbal 
* Long-term over short-term 
* I offer trust first 
* Don't lie to me 
* Bad news doesn't age well 
* Team over individual 
* Remote-first 
* We're professionals and adults

Well, that's 30 words for now, anyway.
