As Colin Powell put [it](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/colin_powell_137376"):

> “Bad news isn't wine. It doesn't improve with age.”

The longer we put off bad news, the worse it is.

* The anxiety about it grows over time
* The runway to deal with it shrinks

It may seem silly to bring up something that isn't a big deal now; you may even feel like a "chicken little", but it is courageous to have difficult conversations early.
