title: Lift and Shift

One of the biggest struggles for teams with a legacy codebase and a large user base is the "Lift and Shift". This is when a legacy system has been flagged for refactoring on a new technology platform, but no one dares to change the system. Users are comfortable with the legacy system and don't want to change. Business leaders don't see how to change things because they've "always done it that way". So IT is stuck moving a bad, outdated system to new technology.
