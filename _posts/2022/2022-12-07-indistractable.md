*Okay, I watched a free webinar that was a sales pitch to sign up for a paid course. I know.*

The webinar I watched covered some high points I thought were interesting:

> "The opposite of distraction is traction" [related](https://www.nirandfar.com/opposite-of-distraction/)

Most people would say the opposite of distraction is focus, but it is traction. Both distraction and traction have "action" in them. It's a matter of moving toward or away from what we want.

> "The time you plan to waste is not wasted time"

If I'm going to scroll through Twitter, it should be intentional and therefore not a distraction.

> "Time management is about pain management"

We get distracted because we're avoiding pain.

> "Consistency over intensity"

Continue to show up and build indistructable habits. Don't worry about how intense you are; keep showing up. (This is good advice things like exercise!)

> "Did I do what I said I was going to do, for as long as I said I was going to, without distraction?"

This is the key evaluation at the end of the day.

Eyal listed a four step process (which the course will cover in detail, of course) to become indistractable:

1. Master internal triggers
2. Make time for traction
3. Hack back external triggers
4. Create a pact
