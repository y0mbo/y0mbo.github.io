In this [StackOverflow blog](https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/11/23/why-writing-by-hand-is-still-the-best-way-to-retain-information/) post, Corissa E Haury notes a study of paper versus digital and the retention of the information:

> A recent study led by neuroscientist Professor Kuniyoshi Sakai at the University of Tokyo published in March 2021 showed that subjects who recorded calendar event information on paper showed more brain activity than subjects who recorded the same information onto a smartphone when they attempted to recall details about that calendar information later. And they recalled/entered the information 25% faster when writing it by hand.

In my ongoing battle between digital and analog, this is another shift toward paper again. I started a new paper journal to write down the things I come across to capture my thoughts in a way I can recall it later.
