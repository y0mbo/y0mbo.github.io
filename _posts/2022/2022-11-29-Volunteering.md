This tweet is one I stand by:

> "If someone ever tells you I sent them to you to do something for them, DO NOT believe them. I will always check with you before volunteering you for an additional task." -  [@engineering_bae](https://twitter.com/engineering_bae/status/1590808043213971457)

I strive to minimize the work-in-progress for my team and keep everyone focused during their maker time. Nothing is worse than some random task interrupting one's flow. I also will check with you to see if you can fit a jump ball into your schedule and work to understand the demands on your time.
