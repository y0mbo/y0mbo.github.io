Creating goals and plans at the annual level is daunting and difficult. As most New Year's Resolutions go, they're abandoned within the first week (at least the fitness industry would tell you so).

It makes more sense to create goals on a shorter timeframe, but weeks and months are hardly enough time to accomplish anything of significance.

A few years ago I came across a post by Jon Acuff with a different approach: 7 by 52. Seven periods of 52 days (and one extra day to get to 365). Long enough to make serious plans, and short enough to stick to them.

## The 7x52 schedule

Segment 1: January 1 - February 21  
Segment 2: February 22 - April 14  
Segment 3: April 15 - June 6  
Segment 4: June 7 - July 29  
Segment 5: July 30 - September 20  
Segment 6: September 21  - November 12  
Segment 7: November 13 - December 31

What will you accomplish in the first 52 this year?
