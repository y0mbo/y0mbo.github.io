I felt a little lost the other day, holding a pity party about my skills and abilities. My wife encouraged me to take the Clifton Strengthsfinder to better understand my skills. The test is pricey ($50 USD) but worth it!

You answer a series of 177 questions and are presented with two options. You select on a scale of 5 whether you agree with one or the other options or are neutral in the middle. The test takes about 20 minutes, and the results are ready immediately afterward.

I. Was. Blow.  Away.

I didn’t think the questions pertained to much of anything, and sometimes the choices didn’t even seem like opposites. Yet the results pegged me perfectly.

My number one trait is “Input”. It is a skill that collects information and stores it for use later and uses that information as part of a strategic thinking skill set. This explains so much about me - my love for collecting bookmarks and reading. My 10 thousand notes in Evernote will confirm this about me.
